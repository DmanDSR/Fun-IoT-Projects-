# Fun-IoT-Projects- C++
IoT Projects that are fun and also good to start off with 

1. 2_LED_Blink
   - Code demonstrating two LEDs alternating between on and off states at distinct intervals.
     
2. Calculating_Area_and_perimeter_of_triangle
   - This code computes the area and perimeter of a triangle using user-provided input
     
3. LED_input_blink_rate
    - This code prompts the user to set the blinking rate of an LED using numbers from 1 to 9

4. MPU-6050-Acceleromater
     - Code designed to experiment with an accelerometer and explore its integration with a microcontroller.
  
5. RGB_LED
     - Code programmed to cycle through various colors of an RGB LED.
  
6. activer_buzzer_KH
     - Code designed to play the iconic melody from Kingdom Hearts on an active buzzer module.
  
7. push_Button_RGB_LED
     -  This code activates an RGB LED using one button, then proceeds to cycle through six distinct colors with each subsequent press of the same button, and finally turns off the RGB LED using another button.
